# VibeKit

**Motion & Microinteraction Library for Modern Web Applications.**

[**🚀 Live Demo**](https://Anxthu.github.io/Vibekit-microintraction/)

VibeKit is a collection of high-quality, interactive, and customizable motion components designed to elevate the user experience of your web projects. By integrating smooth animations and responsive micro-interactions, VibeKit helps bridge the gap between static interfaces and dynamic, engaging user journeys.

## ✨ UI/UX Focus

VibeKit isn't just about "flashy" animations; it's about **usability** and **delight**.

-   **Feedback & Affordance**: Components like **Lift** and **Glow** provide immediate visual feedback, signaling interactivity and rewarding user actions.
-   **Error Handling**: The **Shake** animation offers a clear, intuitive, and non-intrusive way to communicate errors or invalid states.
-   **Visual Hierarchy**: **3D Tilt** and **Pulse** effects guide user attention to key elements, establishing a natural flow and hierarchy.
-   **Fluidity**: Built with **Lenis** for smooth scrolling and **Framer Motion** for seamless transitions, ensuring the application feels polished and responsive.

## 🛠️ Built With (DevX)

Designed for modern developers, VibeKit leverages the best in the React ecosystem for performance and ease of use.

-   **[React 19](https://react.dev/)**: Built on the latest React standards for robust component architecture.
-   **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**: Powering complex 2D animations with a simple, declarative API.
-   **[React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber)**: Bringing high-performance 3D elements to the web with minimal boilerplate.
-   **[Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/)**: For buttery smooth scroll interpolation.
-   **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: Ensuring a lightning-fast development environment and optimized production builds.

## 📦 Features

-   **Lift**: Elevates elements on hover with smooth spring physics, perfect for cards and buttons.
-   **Glow**: Adds a dynamic, cursor-aware glow effect to highlight active areas.
-   **Shake**: Physics-based wiggle animations for error states, notifications, or playful interactions.
-   **Pulse**: Rhythmic breathing effects to indicate urgency, activity, or live status.
-   **3D Tilt**: Premium, hardware-accelerated 3D cursor-following tilt effect for immersive cards.
-   **Morph**: Smooth shape transformations for fluid state changes.
-   **Retro 3D Hero**: A procedural, vaporwave-aesthetic 3D landscape generator.
